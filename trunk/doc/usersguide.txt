===============

  Dating back to 1972, C is one of the oldest programming languages still
in wide use. There are three main reasons for its longevity:

  .# it's a system language that provides a tiny abstraction over the
     underlying platform which makes it perfect choice for writing code
     that directly interacts with hardware components (e.g. device drivers,
     embedded software).
  
   # it can be compiled to fast, compact assembler code. Critical components
     that require the maximum speed can be coded directly in C (e.g. a
     physics engine for a game);
     
   # it's available on a variety of platforms and can be integrated with other
     languages, giving the opportunity of writing portable, interoperable code
     '(yes, that's easier said then done, but, at least, the opportunity is
     there :) );
  ..
       
  Unfortunately, its simplicity is also the cause of its main drawbacks. 
Being a low-level language means that the programmer is responsible for many
tedious tasks.
